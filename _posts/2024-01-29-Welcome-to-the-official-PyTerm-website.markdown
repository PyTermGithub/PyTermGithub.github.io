I learnt jekyll today to make this website, it turned out to be really simple
a mirical I know, I will make sure to write posts whenever there is a large enough
update to actually speak about.

I also made a github account for this project and am planning on making a video documenting
its features.

For now you can contribute [here](https://github.com/PyTermGithub/PyTerm) for the main project
and [here](https://github.com/PyTermGithub/PyTermGithub.github.io) for the website
If this project expands enough I *may* buy a domain
